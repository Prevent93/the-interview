	 *      * uncompress the gzip file
	 *      * store that uncompressed file somewhere
	 *      * go row by row and insert the data into a database.
	 *

	 *      * the gzip files could be 250MB big
	 *      * uncompressed files more then 2GB big
	 *      * we want to use as little RAM as possible ;)
	 *      * we deploy code with a memory limit of 512MB ... not enough ram to
	 *        store all of the CSV file or rows to insert in the database in one go.
	 *
	 *  Bonus notes:
	 *
	 *      * chunking inserts into the database would be nice
	 *
	 *      * str_getcsv has some bugs. as a hint, check out the PHP documentation,
	 *        and read the comment from Ryan Rubley. These bugs will be hit with well-formed
