=========

This is a simple CSV project.

A framework has been created that will roughly simulate how the CSV job will run.

To test the code, we will run run.php.

We need to open the compressed file (provided sperately) into a database.

Some code (load_laravel.php) has been included to help bootstrap Laravel from the command line.

Note that this code will need to run using Laravel, feel free to change this to your favorite framework,
or even not to use any framework at all. We are not testing you on your ability to use a framework, but
rather your ability to solve one issue.

You will need to design an efficient table structure. Please provide an SQL dump of your table's
structure.
